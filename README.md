# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This challenge was to create a Work Day Scheduler so that users can add tasks and events to effectively manage their time.  The scheduler was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. Tasks and events are saved, even upon page refresh.  Time blocks are color coded to indicate past, present, or future.
